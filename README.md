### Hello, Welcome to Ayushi's page!

I am currently working on building a recommender system using Amazon open dataset 'Amazon Customer Reviews Dataset' with 130+ million customer reviews. I will update my progress and results here on Github so stay tuned! 

Over the past year, I worked as a Data Engineer/Analyst at a Fintech Saas firm in NYC. I worked on developing an automation tool to monitor data feeds from 200+ data sources for 1000+ financial services B2B customers in Python. I performed root casue analysis for optimizing data feeds, led quality assurance (QA) and testing of migrated data through data modeling and transformations in Informatica Cloud and have a proven track record to streamline migration experience from legacy to new product worked on user stories for business intelligence dashboards using product and project management. I carried out data analysis and developed reports for senior leadership and provided actionable recommendations. 

Technical Skillset: Python, SQL, Tableau, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Agile, JIRA, Project Management

I'm a data enthusiast and finding ways to work on latest data challenges. When I am not working on solving a data challenge, you will find me experimenting a new recipe in the kitchen. I love Indian and Italian food!

I have completed my Master's in Quantitative Finance and Risk Analytics from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I have a Bachelor's in Engineering - Information Technology from D.J Sanghvi College of Engineering, Mumbai.
