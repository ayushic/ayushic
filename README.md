### Hello, Welcome to my page! 

Over the past year, I worked as a Data Engineer/Analyst at a Fintech Saas firm in NYC. I worked on developing an automation tool to monitor data feeds from 200+ data sources for 1000+ financial services B2B customers in Python. I performed root casue analysis for optimizing data feeds, led quality assurance (QA) and testing of migrated data through data modeling and transformations in Informatica Cloud and have a proven track record to streamline migration experience from legacy to new product and worked on user stories for business intelligence dashboards using product and project management principles. I carried out data analysis and developed reports for senior leadership and provided actionable recommendations. 

I am currently working on building a recommender system using Amazon open dataset 'Amazon Customer Reviews Dataset' with 130+ million customer reviews. I will update my progress and results here on Github so stay tuned! 

**Technical Skillset:** Python, SQL, Tableau, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Statistics, R, Agile, JIRA, Project Management, Product & Data Operations

I'm a data enthusiast and finding ways to work on latest data challenges and learning new data techniques. When I am not working on solving a data challenge, you will find me either travelling or experimenting a new recipes in the kitchen. I love Indian and Italian food!
